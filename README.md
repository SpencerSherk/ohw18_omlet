## The problem

To make an OMLET you need to crack some data. We made machine learning models that have been trained on shipboard data to explore the data around OOI installations Station Papa, Coastal Pioneer, and Coastal Endurance. We tracked the following parameters:
* Temperature
* Salinity
* Dissolved Oxygen
* Chlorophyll

In order to eggsecute the hack we use toolkits, such as:
* Keras
* SciKit-Learn

## Application Example

We took shipboard data, such as a (sub)set of Line P data for Station Papa, and train the network to recognize good data vs anomalous data. Anomalous data can represent a problem with the sensor to an interesting phenomena different from the norm.
